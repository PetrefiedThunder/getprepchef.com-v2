## Executive Summary

### Business Overview
PrepChef is a RegTech (Regulatory Technology) SaaS platform that automates vendor compliance verification for shared kitchen operators, ghost kitchens, and commissaries. We transform the time-consuming, manual process of verifying food vendor licenses and permits into an automated, intelligent system that ensures regulatory compliance while dramatically reducing operational overhead.

### Problem Statement
The shared kitchen industry faces a critical compliance challenge:

- **Regulatory requirements** change frequently, requiring constant monitoring across multiple jurisdictions
- **Liability risks** from non-compliant vendors can result in fines, shutdowns, and legal exposure
- **Manual processes** don't scale, limiting kitchen operators' ability to grow their vendor base

### Solution
PrepChef provides an automated vendor verification platform that:
- Generates intelligent compliance checklists based on jurisdiction and business type
- Automates document verification with expiration tracking
- Monitors regulatory changes across all jurisdictions
- Sends real-time notifications for compliance status changes

### Unit Economics

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**
- **Year 1:** $2,000 per customer (high due to early stage inefficiency)
- **Year 2:** $1,000 per customer (improving efficiency, product-led growth)
- **Year 3:** $600 per customer (scaled marketing, referrals, organic)

**Lifetime Value (LTV):**
- **Assumptions:**
  - Average customer lifetime: 48 months (4 years)
  - Monthly churn: 2% (logo churn decreases over time)
  - Average ARPA: $425/month (blended)
  - Gross margin: 85%

- **LTV Calculation:** $425 × 48 months × 85% margin = **$17,340**

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- **Year 1:** $17,340 / $2,000 = 8.7:1 (excellent, but small sample)
- **Year 2:** $17,340 / $1,000 = 17.3:1 (very strong)
- **Year 3:** $17,340 / $600 = 28.9:1 (world-class)

**Months to Recover CAC:**
- **Year 1:** $2,000 / ($300 × 85%) = 7.8 months
- **Year 2:** $1,000 / ($425 × 85%) = 2.8 months
- **Year 3:** $600 / ($525 × 85%) = 1.3 months

### Cash Flow Projections

**Year 1 Cash Flow:**
- Beginning Cash: $750,000 (seed funding)
- Operating Cash Flow: -$360,000
- Ending Cash: $390,000

- Ending Cash: $307,500

**Year 3 Cash Flow:**
- Beginning Cash: $307,500
- Operating Cash Flow: +$856,000
- Ending Cash: $1,163,500
- **Cash flow positive, self-sustaining**

### Key Financial Milestones
